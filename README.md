# Battle simulation on UE4 with Twitch integration

**Engine:** UE4 4.23.4  
**Plugin for Twitch Chat integration:** https://github.com/TheDiG3/TwitchPlay

My first more or less good enough project on UE4. It is not a simple game, it is a battle simulation where you just a spectator. The participants take part in this game due to the Twitch chat (such kind format is widely used by streamers to choose someone from the chat to give him some prize). The game made in Japanesse style, there are two teams (samurais and ronins). Team of ronins attacks the castle and samurais defend it. The winner is the surviover with the largest amount of kills.
